## Bank Rate
- Refers to the official interest rate at which RBI provides loans to the banking system
- It includes
	- commercial/cooperative banks
	- development banks etc.
- such loans are given out by
	- direct lending
	- rediscounting (buying back) the bills of commercial banks and treasury bills
- `Bank rate is also known as discount rate`
- Objective
	- When RBI increases the bank rate, the cost of borrowing for banks rises
	- this credit volume gets reduced leading to decline in supply of money
	- thus, **`increase in bank rate reflects tightening of RBI monetary policy`**
---
## Repo Rate
- Repurchase rate
- Rate at which RBI lends to banks for short periods
- Done by RBI buying government bonds from banks with an agreement to sell them back at a fixed rate
- Objective
	- inject liquidity in the system
	- **`increased repo rate -> expensive for banks to borrow`**
	- **`decreased repo rate -> cheaper for banks to borrow`**
---
## Bank Rate vs Repo Rate
- Repo rate is a short term measure and it refers to short-term lonas and used for controlling amount of money in market
- Bank rate is a long term measure and is governed by the long-term monetary policy of RBI

---
## Reverse Repo Rate
- Rate of interest at which the RBI borrows funds from other banks in the short term
- Done by RBI selling `government bonds` or `securities` to banks with commitment to buy them back at a future date
- Bank use reverse repo facility to `deposit their short term excess funds with RBI` and `earn interest for it`
- RBI can reduce liquidity in banking system by increasing the rate at which it borrows from banks
- Procedure
	- When RBI increases the reverse repo, it means that now RBI will provide extra interest on the money which it borrows from the banks.
	- An increase in reverse repo rate means that banks earn higher returns by lending to RBI
	- This indicates a hike in deposit rates
	- pushes up interest rates

---
## Open Market Operations
- **`Purchase and Sale of the Government Securities by RBI from/to market`**
- When there is excess of liquidity RBI resorts to **`sale of G-secs`** to suck out rupee from system
- When there is liquidity crunch, RBI buys securities from the market in order to release liquidity
- Objective
	- carried out to adjust liquidity condition of rupee in the economy
	- when RBI sells g-secs to banks
	- as soon as banks purchase g-secs, they have reduced money to lend to the industrial houses or other commercial sectors
	- this reduces surplus cash, contracts the rupee liquidity
	- contracts credit creation / credit supply

---
## Cash Reserve Ratio
- It is the amount of funds that the banks are bound to keep with RBI as a percentage of their Net Demand and Time Liabilities (NDTL)
- **`CRR = Cash Deposited with RBI / NDTL`**
- **CRR has to be maintained on a daily basis with RBI by every bank**
- Objective
	- Ensure adequate liquidity in financial system
	- enough solvency for banks
	- CRR is maintained fortnightly average basis
- CRR is altered by RBI
- **`RBI does not pay any interest on the CRR balances`**
- Reduction of CRR
	- excess funds are available with banks for deploying in other businesses because they are required to keep lesser amounts with RBI
	- banks would have more money to lend
	- this leads to reduction of interest rates on loans provided by banks
	- example
		- SBI has balance of 100 crores
		- CRR @5%
		- SBI has to maintain atleast 5cr with RBI
		- Only has 95cr to its disposal
		- If CRR @4.5%
		- SBI can lend more now outside as it has 95.5cr to its disposal
	- Impact on inflation
		- Reduction in CRR leaves more money in the hands of commercial banks and this leads to increase in money supply in system
		- When money supply rises, too much money chases too few goods and this leads to rise in inflation
- Increase in CRR
	- banks will have less money
	- since banks don't earn any interest, banks are left with no option but to increase the interest rates
	- hike in CRR sucks money out of system causing inflation to come down
- **From 2006, RBI is empowered to fix the CRR on its discretion without any ceiling**

---
## Statutory Liquidity Ratio
- All banks have to keep a fraction of their total net time and demand liabilites in form of liquid assets such as
	- G-secs
	- precious metals
	- approved securities amongst others
- Maintained with banks themselves
- **`SLR = Liquid Assets / NDTL`**
- **Ratio was prescribed by Section 24(2A) of Banking Regulation Act 1949**
- Original ratio mandated for a `23% SLR`
- **`Presently 21% (August 2016)`**
- SLR deposits include
	- Cash
	- Gold reserves kept in bank
	- Balances with RBI
	- Net balance in current account
	- Investment in G-secs(if any)
- **SLR has to be maintained on a daily basis by every bank**
- SLR is inversely proportional to money in market

---
## CRR vs SLR
|Key|CRR|SRR|
|---|---|---|
|Stored in form of |Cash|Liquid Assets|
|Stored With|RBI(in their premises)|Bank themselves|
|Ratio comparison|Less than SLR|More than CRR|
|Current Rates|4%|21.5%|

## Liquidity Adjustment Facility
- This is the primary instrument of RBI for modulating liquidity and sending interest rate signals to the market
- It refers to the difference b/w the two key rates
	- repo rate
	- reverse repo rate
- Also known as **Liquidity Corridor**
- While repo infuses liquidity into the system, reverse repo absorbs liquidity from system
- **RBI just announces Repo Rate**
- **Reverse repo rate is linked to repo rate and is 100 basis points (1%) below repo rate**

---
## Marginal Standing Facility
- Created by **`RBI in its credit policy of may 2011`**
- MSF is the rate at which banks are able to borrow overnight funds from RBI against apporved government securities
- **MSF is always 1% higher than Repo rate**

---
## Qualitative Tools
- Those tools thru which the central bank not only controls the value of loans but also the purpose for which these loans are assigned by the commercial banks
	- Moral suasion
	- Rationing of credit
	- Direct Action
	- Margin requirements

#### Moral Suasion
- Suasion means request or persuasion
- To arrest inflationary situation central bank persuades and requests the commercial banks to refrain from giving loans for speculative and non-essential purposes
- To counter deflation, central bank persuades the commercial banks to extend credit for different purposes
- Periodic discussions are held with authorities of commercial banks in this respect from 1949

#### Rationing of Credit
- Method by which the RBI seeks to limit the maximum amount of loans and advances
- Also in certain cases, fix ceiling for specific categories of loans and advances
- **Priority Sector Landing** - making credit flow to certain priority or weaker sectorsnby charging concessional rates of interest
