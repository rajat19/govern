# Wildlife and Ecology related data
## Aquatic organisms
- **Neustons** - Unattached organisms which live at air-water interface such as floating plants, etc.
- **Periphytons** - They remain attached to stems and leaves of rooted plants or substances emerging aboce the bottom mud such as sessile algae
- **Planktons** 
	- These are free floating species with limited powers of locomotion
	- This group includes 
		- microscopic plants like algae (**phytoplanktons**)
		- animals like crustaceans and protozoans (**zooplanktons**)
- **Nektons** - This group includes animals which are swimmers
	- The animals range in size from the swimming insects to the the largest animals, **blue whale**
- **Benthos** - These are found living in the bottom of water mass

## Ecological Relationships
|Effect on X|Effect on Y|Type of interaction|
|---|---|---|
|-|-|Competition|
|-|0|Amensalism|
|-|+|Exploitation|
|0|0|Neutralism|
|0|+|Commensalism|
|+|+|Mutualism|

### Amensalism
- Organism inflicts harm to another organism without any costs or benefits received by itself
- eg. Sheep trampling grass

### Exploitation
- one species benefits at the expense of other
- eg. Predation, Parasitism, Herbivory
- Batesian mimicry is an exploitative interaction, where one species has evolved to mimic another, to the advantage of copying species but to the detriment of the species being mimicked

### Neutralism
- interact but do not affect each other

### Commensalism
- benefits one organism and the other organism is neither benefited nor harmed

### Mutualism
- species derive mutual benefit, for example an increased carrying capacity

### Competition
- interaction in which the fitness of one is lowered by the presence of another
